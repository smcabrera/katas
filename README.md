Code katas from exercism.io and codewars

My goal here is to improve my coding skills by working through code katas collaboratively with others.

If you're interested in working on some coding exercises with me, here's one easy way we can work together: 
- sign up for a free account with cloud9, a cloud editor that lets you collaborate on open source projects for free
- private message me your email address on twitter @stephenmarian0 and I'll give you access my cloud9 box so we can start hacking 

Alternatively you could host the exercises yourself. If you want to use the same setup I did here's how. 
- Fork this repository
- Install this [cloud9 extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cloud9-button-for-github/gkddhhofgajgmgfebhaiihlahjmjkmph) for github.
- The extension should give you a "Clone in Github button", click that button on your fork of this repository

You'll have a free, publicly viewable ubuntu box with a bunch of software preinstalled (ruby, php, node). You can follow the instructions on exercism.io to install the command line application for that. Codewars has their own web interface but I've copy and pasted questions from to work on them locally (and now, via cloud9 as well). 

Instructions for installing and configuring exercism.io can be found [here](http://help.exercism.io/installing-the-cli-on-linux.html)
