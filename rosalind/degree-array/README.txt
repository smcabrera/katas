In an undirected graph, the degree of a vertex is the
number of neighbors has, or equivalently, the number of edges
incident upon it.

Given: A simple graph with vertices in the edge
list format.

Return: An array where is the degree of vertex .
See Figure 3 for visual example from the sample dataset.

Sample Dataset

edge_list = [
  [6, 7],
  [1, 2],
  [2, 3],
  [6, 3],
  [5, 6],
  [2, 5],
  [2, 4],
  [4, 1]
]

Sample Output
[2, 4, 2, 2, 2, 2]
